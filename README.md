# social-network-api

## Description
In the UT Austin Coding Bootcamp, challenge 18 was creating a Social Network API where users could post thoughts, add reactions to thoughts and have a friends list of other users. The packages used to create the API were ***express.js*** for simplifying APIs, ***mongoose*** the ODM of the database, ***mongoose-lean-virtuals*** and ***mongoose-lean-getters*** to correctly send the document as plain old javascript object with virtuals and getters enabled. Then, the database that is being utilized for this application is MongoDB, hence the mongoose package.
